										<h3>Challenges I had encountered</h3>
											<p>Since Forex trading isn't a well-known investment in Taiwan, there are only a few people who are familiar with it, which led to many challenges to my responsibility as an introducing broker(IB).</p>
										<h3>What should be accomplished</h3>
											<p>It took longer for prospecting clients to accept and acknowledge that FX is not only legit but also like any other investment that needs consistent learning in order to build up the right mindset.</p>
										<h3>What I did</h3>
											<p>Therefore, we first invited people who were interested in learning more about FX to our weekly events, educating them with the relevant knowledge by demonstrating trading software, and sharing investment-related topics and dos/don'ts when it comes to investing.</p>
										<h3>What I achieved & learned</h3>
											<p>As a result, I could hold a 30mins presentation individually and was able to maintain a long-term relationship with 20 clients who had consistently invested over $5000 per month per person. From the weekly events, I've become more confident in sharing my opinions in public because I've gained a lot of opportunities to practice public speaking which wasn't easy for me at first as I tend to be introverted. Overall, it was a valuable experience for me.</p>
