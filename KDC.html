											<h3>Why KDC?</h3>
										</div>
											<p>I love dancing! And I'd danced for 10+ years. Due to my passion for it, I decided to start a service for people who would like to learn street dance with my friends I knew in university.</p> 
											<h3>What I did?</h3>
										<p>At first, I was excited and did everything myself, from finding a good photographer, building a Facebook fan page, creating and editing videos and posts and sharing across relevant Facebook groups, learning how to advertise on Facebook, etc.</p>		
										<p>Two weeks later or so, our FB page reached about 400 followers without running FB ads, and our busiest time was 6 classes per week.</p>	
										<h3>What challenges I had?</h3>
										<p>However, it wasn't easy to manage this business for a few reasons. Firstly, most teachers (my friends) in KDC all work full-time jobs, which caused uncertainty when matching the schedule with the customers'. Secondly, we didn't have a website to drive organic traffic. As a result, we lost opportunities to build brand awareness and convert the leads. Lastly, there were not enough trustworthy teachers to work with and answer course-related questions from parents.</p>
										<h3>What would I do if I could start again?</h3>
										<p>After a comprehensive review of KDC, If I would started the business over again, I would have created a website and recruited qualified teachers.</p>
