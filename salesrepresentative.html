										<p>My role in a well-known life insurance company as a sales representative in Taiwan was the first and foremost experience that built up my passion for marketing. During that time, I helped clients find the best products based on their budget, career risks level, life expectations, etc. With the support from my supervisors and the opportunities given by clients, I had won multiple prizes that showed my ability and value toward the company.</p>
										<p>At the beginning of doing this job, I'd encountered various challenges that made me frustrated. For example, people in my country usually share a negative impression of a salesperson, so it took me a lot of effort and time to adapt to this situation.</p>
										<p>So, "what was the biggest achievement I had made in this job?" if you asked. I'd say that because most of the clients that acquired were strangers to me, they weren't as friendly as I expected when I tried to approach them in the first place. However, we ended up in a trusted relationship. The bonding was the achievement and the reward that made me grow the most.</p>
