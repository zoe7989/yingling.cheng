										<p>From my experience, the way to acquire new customers as a salesperson and an introducing broker(IB) was very different. Forex trading is not a mainstream investment market in Taiwan, and there are only a small group of people familiar with it. Therefore, it indirectly caused many challenges to our job.</p>
											<p>It took longer for those potential customers to be convinced and know that FX is legit and needs consistently learning to build up the right mindset. Therefore, to achieve that purpose, we would first invite them to our weekly events, educating them with the relevant knowledge of investment and FX trading.</p>
											<p>The role I played in the team gave me a lot of opportunities to practice public speaking, but it wasn't easy at first, especially when I was introverted. However, I've grown more than I expected by keeping practicing and managing to maintain a long-term trusted relationship with my customers.</p>
