									<p>As a sales representative who worked at a well-known life insurance companyÂ in Taiwan was where my passion for marketing started. During that time, I helped clients find the best products based on their budget, risk level, life expectations, etc. With the support from my supervisors and the trust between the clients and me, I won multiple prizes which demonstrated my ability and value toward the company.</p>	
									<p>At the beginning of doing this job, I encountered many challenges that made me frustrated. For example, in Taiwan, people generally share a negative impression of sales representatives because they think these people are prone to making money out of relationships, It took me a lot of effort and time to adapt to this situation and develop a trusted relationship with new clients.</p>
									<p>I knew that I needed to consistently make cold calls, attend new events, network, and do the best I could to treat every client sincerely. Although things were not always as easy as it seemed, by continuously taking these actions, those who weren't as friendly as I expected would eventually see my effort, which ended up becoming clients who would come back to me whenever needed, and this was the achievement and the reward that motivated me to grow and serve.</p>
