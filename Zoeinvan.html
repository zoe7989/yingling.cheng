											<h3>Why did I blog?</h3>
										</div>
									<ol>
										<p>The purpose of creating this blog was to share information about how to apply for the Canadien Student permit and the college in Vancouver, and there was also some English test preparing tips. I found out that there wasn't much helpful information on the internet regarding those topics. Therefore, I wanted to write down my journey to Canada for those who wish to study here.</p>										
										<p>I'm convinced that the best way to learn is by doing. Although I already enrolled as a digital marketing student, there would be plenty of chances to learn and practice. However, I want more. So I built this website to gain hands-on experiences in web design, content writing, SEO, and more!</p>
									</ol>
										
									<h3>What challenges did I encountered?</h3>
									<ol>
									<li>Lacked effective keywords search tools(free ones, of course) and most of them don't offer relevant data in my native language.</li>
									<li>Had difficulties in sharing things based on my personal experience due to COVID 19, because it's a micro-niche blog, and it became harder and harder to write new things under the situation being quarantined and having virtual learning at home.									</li>
									</ol>
									<h3>What did I do to deal with the chanllenges?</h3>
									<p>I decided to sharpen my skills and obtain knowledge to adapt to the restrictions. I learned how to conduct market research on SERPs, tried implementing SEO audit and link building. Although my website won't rank to the top1 overnight, I would still keep working on my disadvantages and strengthening my advantages because I know it's a long way to be a qualified marketer.
